# Chuck Norris Joke List

The challenge for this project was to work in a group and build a full stack web application. We thought it would be fun to build a jokes app. Our idea was to build an app where you could create, edit and store your own personal list of jokes. On top of that, you can also access the Chuck Norris joke API for inspiration. We liked the simplicity of having your own personal jokes on demand ready to be deployed in any conversation!

# Results, Successes & Improvements

We are proud to present our fullstack application that could get a room laughing! This product definitely went over well with our collegues. In the future, we plan to build upon what we have already created, such as, adding features to store your favorites, a list for jokes that are under construction and a jokes ranking (so other users can rate your joke and provide feedback). Stay tuned for our future updates! 

Thank you for checking us out!
